# GenAI RAG System – Learning & Design Phase

## Overview
This repository is created as part of my internship learning phase to understand and design a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** based system for document querying and chatbot-style interactions.

The initial focus of this repository is on **conceptual understanding, architecture design, and documentation**, before moving towards implementation.

---


## Current Status
- Studying fundamentals of RAG and its real-world use cases.
- Reviewing technical articles and reference material.
- Organizing learnings using tools like NotebookLM.
- Understanding end-to-end RAG workflows at a high level.

---

## Next Steps
- Deep dive into individual RAG components and their roles.
- Draft a high-level architecture flow for a generic RAG system.
- Gradually evolve this repository to include design diagrams and implementation code.
