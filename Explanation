What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an approach where relevant information is first retrieved from a document source and then provided as context to a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate accurate and grounded responses.

RAG helps overcome limitations of plain LLM-based systems by reducing hallucinations and improving response relevance.

Key Components of a RAG System
Based on initial study and research, a typical RAG pipeline consists of the following components:

Document Ingestion

Source documents are collected and prepared for processing.
Chunking

Large documents are split into smaller, meaningful chunks to preserve context.
Embeddings

Text chunks are converted into numerical vector representations that capture semantic meaning.
Vector Database

Stores embeddings and enables semantic similarity search.
Retriever

Retrieves the most relevant document chunks based on a user query.
Large Language Model (LLM)

Generates responses using the retrieved document context.
